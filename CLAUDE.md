# Statistical Arbitrage Trade — Project Memory

Basis/stat-arb trading system on MetaTrader 5 (Gold & Silver, spot vs
futures, swap-cost-based signals).

## Goal

Run Leg A (spot) on Account A and Leg B (futures) on Account B —
different brokers or same broker — streaming prices from both and
routing each leg's order to its own account.

## Hard constraints — do not re-litigate

- **The MetaTrader5 Python package holds ONE global connection per
  process.** A second `mt5.initialize()` replaces the first. True
  simultaneous two-account streaming uses **one leg runner process
  per account** (`run_leg.py`, own terminal via `path=`) plus the
  coordinator (`run_coordinator.py`) that fuses prices and routes
  orders over localhost TCP (built 2026-07). Same-account setups run
  the coordinator alone (in-process LocalLeg).
- **Scale requirements (owner, 2026-07):** ~500 lots of gold notional
  per day (`DAILY_LOT_TARGET` — a throughput target, NOT a cap; never
  reject on it). Each trade = 50-lot spot clip + 50-lot futures hedge
  (`CLIP_LOTS`), sliced into 10-lot child orders (`SLICE_LOTS`).
  Futures hedge is sized to actual spot FILL; partial-fill policies
  live in `pair_executor.py` and are covered by tests.
- **Never run LIVE mode without the tests passing** (`pytest tests/`).
  The money paths (entry pair, close pair, hedge unwind, stop loss)
  are covered by tests using a FakeBroker — no MT5 needed.
- Credentials live in `.env` (gitignored), referenced from
  config.json via `password_env`. Never in code, config, or chat.

## Strategy (decided 2026-07; spec v2 applied 2026-07)

- Entries: z-score on swap_diff (basis minus swap-implied basis — the
  carry-detrended spread). ALL gates must pass: warm stats, |z| >=
  ENTRY_Z, |z| < MAX_ENTRY_Z (entry ceiling — its OWN knob, always
  active, keep the band >= 1 sigma wide; a z at 5+ is a momentum
  spike, their extreme entries went 0-for-3), trend filter, cooldowns,
  z-reset after stops, edge filter (capture >= 1.5x round-trip cost).
- Atomic pre-checks: BOTH legs' symbol minimums verified before
  placing EITHER order (PairExecutor._precheck_pair).
- Exits: DOLLAR levels frozen at entry from actual fills. Priority:
  DOLLAR_STOP (ungated; tighter of TP/RR, %-capital when LEVERAGE
  set, per-lot) > TAKE_PROFIT (sigma-fraction > %-capital > fixed $,
  cost floor) > gated reversion exit — the gate DEFERS to max-hold:
  floor decays to break-even past 1x max-hold, releases entirely past
  2x (deadlock fix: gate+max-hold+unreachable TP once held a fully
  reverted trade at +$1.19 over 2 cents, then bled to -$4.46) >
  MAX_HOLD (4x half-life, profit only, suppressed while z-progress
  >= 50% toward an EXISTING TP) > TIME_STOP hard clock at 3x max-hold
  regardless of P&L (the sideways loser's only exit) > Z_STOP,
  DEMOTED: off by default while a dollar stop is armed, auto-re-
  enabled when none is (a trade must always have a stop), would-have-
  fired occasions LOGGED for design scoring.
- Exit-path completeness rule: every (P&L, z, time) state must have a
  reachable exit — regression-tested in tests/test_exits.py.
- Tuning is data-driven: per-trade peak/trough net P&L with minutes-
  after-entry persist to trade_review; set the TP near the 60-70th
  percentile of peaks, max-hold near the median peak-minute of
  winners; verify measured win rate clears stop/(target+stop).
- Every close gets a deterministic outcome tag: TARGET_HIT /
  REVERSION_BANKED / TIME_EXIT / STOPPED_IN_TREND /
  STOPPED_AFTER_FULL_REVERSION (z came home, price never paid).
- Execution: limit-first (rest at peg, re-peg via TRADE_ACTION_MODIFY,
  timeout -> cancel+verify fills -> cross). Stops/unwinds ALWAYS
  market. Hedge leg gets short patience (HEDGE_TIMEOUT_SEC).
- Accounts are HEDGING mode (owner, 2026-07): closes MUST target
  position tickets; plain opposite orders would OPEN positions.
- Partial-fill policy: hedge sized to spot FILL; keep matched piece
  only if >= MIN_MATCHED_FRACTION (0.4) of clip, else unwind all.
- Reconciliation every 20s in LIVE: 3-strike orphan auto-close by
  ticket (booked to untracked_closes ledger, charged to breakers),
  3-strike ghost force-clear. Restart: recover open positions from
  position_state table, reconcile BEFORE trading.

## Hard rules (owner's spec, ported 2026-07)

- NEVER attach broker-side stops to individual legs — one leg stopping
  alone converts the hedge into a naked position.
- z is for ENTRIES; exits act on MONEY (in-trade z "reverts" as the
  rolling mean chases the spread without the price paying you).
- Audit modeled vs realized costs monthly (query trades vs COSTS
  config); alarm if modeled >= 2x realized — an inflated cost model
  silently blocks every good trade.
- Parameters (ENTRY_Z 3.0, STOP_Z 4.5, etc.) are STRUCTURE defaults —
  recalibrate against recorded gold basis data before LIVE.

## Live-tested MT5 lessons (ported 2026-07 from the June
## `claude/limit-orders-trade-exits-q0quM` branch) — don't reintroduce

That branch ran REAL orders; its commit log paid for these rules:

- Orphan pending orders accumulate after timeouts/failed cancels and
  eventually fill as untracked naked positions. Sweep ALL of our
  pending orders on both symbols before every new pair execution
  (`PairExecutor.sweep_stale_orders`).
- Invalid Price (10015): limit prices MUST come from a fresh tick,
  be rounded to `trade_tick_size`, and sit strictly inside the book
  (BUY_LIMIT < ask, SELL_LIMIT > bid) — clamp to bid/ask when an
  offset would cross.
- Some brokers reject RETURN filling on pending orders — choose the
  filling mode from `symbol_info.filling_mode` bitmask (FOK=1, IOC=2,
  else RETURN).
- Deal history lags briefly after a cancel: a zero-fill read right
  after TRADE_ACTION_REMOVE must be re-read before being believed.
- A pending limit with `position=<ticket>` CLOSES that position when
  it executes — non-urgent hedging-mode exits go limit-first (spread
  saved on every exit), escalating to a market ticket-close on
  timeout. Stops still never rest.
- Their cancel-and-replace re-peg needed order_ticket_history to
  track fills across replaced tickets; our MODIFY-based re-peg keeps
  one ticket for the order's life — do not regress to cancel/replace.

## W3 feature port (2026-08, from ajoxf/Stat_Arb_W3_Wsckt
## branch claude/busy-tesla-41ja8f) — status

Applied to the engine:
- Exits are BREAK-EVEN aware: TP/gate/max-hold act on NET = gross -
  round-trip cost ("profit % on top of BE"); dollar stop stays GROSS
  (stop = spread distance, not fees).
- Spread LEVELS frozen at entry for the in-position card: BE/EX/TP/SL
  as absolute swap_diff values (ExitLadder.spread_levels).
- EXIT_MODE zscore|spread|hybrid (spread = crosses the mean frozen at
  entry). HARD_MAX_HOLD_MIN fixed-minutes clock (owner: ~90min, exit
  before the spread starts drifting) alongside HARD_TIME_STOP_MULT.
Web control panel (statarb/webapp.py, own process, file-bridge only):
- Dashboard: in-position card (BE/EX/TP/SL + level $ + gross/net P&L
  + peak/trough + max-hold bar + P&L progress bar), algo start/stop,
  manual market-close button, canvas spread/z charts.
- Settings: ALL config sections + MT5 broker/leg topology editor
  (3 topologies: 2 brokers / 1 broker 2 accounts / 1 account).
  Saves merge into config.json (back-fill — partial saves can't zero
  fields); coordinator hot-reloads safe sections every ~10s via
  AlgoTradingConfig.hot_apply; STRUCTURAL fields (accounts, legs,
  symbols, HEDGE_RATIO) are blocked -> restart; beta change with a
  position open returns 409 (W3 rule).
- Analysis: outcome + edge-quality tiles (win rate, PF, expectancy,
  break-even WR, max DD, P70 peak, median peak-minute), outcome-tag
  counts, excursions table (peak/trough $ @ minutes, capture %),
  trade journal, untracked-close ledger.
- Coordinator control.json: {'algo_enabled', 'close': {...}} — algo
  off stops ENTRIES only; exits always run. MANUAL_CLOSE is urgent
  (market, by ticket).
- SD-touch distribution (z crossings of ±1/2/3 sigma -> sd_touches
  table, chart+table on Analysis) and the shadow "what-if-held"
  tracker (statarb/shadow.py: after every close, marks the position
  virtually until TP/horizon; verdicts REVERTED_TO_TARGET /
  REVERTED_TO_BREAK_EVEN / KEPT_BLEEDING; aggregates suppressed
  below 5 completed) — both ported 2026-08.
Reversibility: tag v1-engine-baseline = pre-port engine; main stays
there until the owner approves this work. NOT yet ported from W3:
Hurst/velocity/trailing optional exits, auto-tuner, AI monitor,
per-leg maker/taker fee split, backtest suite.

## Repo branch map (2026-07)

- `main` = this system (fast-forwarded 2026-07).
- `claude/limit-orders-trade-exits-q0quM` (June): older parallel
  system (adapters/, feature_files/ web app, Telegram bot, OKX).
  Fully superseded 2026-07: MT5 lessons, Telegram notifications and
  the web dashboard are all ported to this system. Only the OKX
  adapter remains unported — the sole reason to keep that branch.
- Other `claude/*` branches: session artifacts, superseded.

## Bugs already found and fixed (2026-07) — don't reintroduce

- Legacy `close_position` routed closes through the entry path with
  `SignalType.NO_SIGNAL` → ValueError → LIVE positions could never be
  closed. Fixed: closes use `OrderManager.execute_close_pair`, which
  reverses each leg's recorded side. Regression tests in
  `tests/test_execution.py`.
- Legacy P&L multiplied price change by lots only, ignoring contract
  size (100 oz/lot gold, 5000 oz/lot silver) → understated ~100x.
  Fixed via `contract_size` in `update_position_pnl`.
- Legacy `mt5.initialize()` took no path/login/server — could only
  attach to whatever terminal happened to be open. Fixed:
  `BrokerSession` passes them from config.

## Decisions made (2026-07)

- Architecture: leg runners + coordinator over localhost TCP (owner
  described the scenario; sequential switching rejected).
- Leg mapping: spot on Broker 1 (e.g. FxPro), futures on Broker 2
  (e.g. CFI); must also work when both legs share one terminal.
- 500 lots/day is a target to aim for, NOT a risk cap.

## Open items (waiting on owner / real-broker validation)

1. Owner's real "working config" (symbols, brokers) was never pushed.
2. HEDGE_RATIO must be verified against both brokers' actual contract
   specs (spot lot = 100 oz vs futures contract size) before LIVE.
3. Futures expiry dates in config must be set to the live contract.
4. Latency budget: coordinator polls at 0.5s; if the basis edge decays
   faster, consider push-streaming ticks from leg runners.

## Conventions

- Develop on the designated `claude/...` branch; commit + push every
  session. No more versioning by filename (`15_..._f.py` era is over).
- Run `pytest tests/ -q` before any commit touching statarb/.
- Futures expiry dates in config must be kept current — an expired
  contract silently zeroes the swap basis and disables signals
  (a warning is logged at startup).
- MT5 package is Windows-only; on Linux/dev machines everything but
  the live connection works (tests, config, imports).
